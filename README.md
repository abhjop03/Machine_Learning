# Machine_Learning
All the machine learning algorithms can be implemented through different approaches: from scratch utilizing brute force techniques, employing linear algorithms, or leveraging pre-existing implementations provided by libraries such as scikit-learn.
So, our goal is to implement these concepts across all algorithms.
